# Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization
Data Analytics and Visualization By Accenture Internship

During this internship, I employed Excel as my primary tool. I initiated the data cleaning process by eliminating null values and rectifying misspelled words. To achieve the desired outcomes and visuals, I merged three sheets using the VLOOKUP function. My analysis was conducted in Excel, utilizing functions such as SUMIF and COUNTIF. Lastly, I crafted visualizations within Excel.

I have also created a PowerPoint presentation to effectively communicate these findings to our client.
